The project uses data from the Yahoo Finance API, downloads the stock data of the last 250 days. The data of the six stocks is then processed in an Esper engine and the processed data gets written into csv files. The csv files then get visualized with d3.js on the website.

The website is fully mobile friendly, through the utilization of bootstrap.

The product is presented in this video below which is available on YouTube:
